# my-weather-daily

My motivation for creating this weather dashboard was to satisfy the common functionality needs of the average person in one place.
I built this project because I am someone who commonly looks at their apple watch and doesn't see enough information in one place.
This project solves the problem of having to google different sources in order to making clothing, driving, traffic, and working decisions.
I learned quite a bit about API's during the development of this project. It was great review for fetch, for loops, and local storage practice.
This project stands out due to the availability of different implementations for different weather data types.
